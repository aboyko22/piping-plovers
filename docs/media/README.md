# Media

Below is a description of all of the media used on the main site.

- `frequency_plot.jpg`: The relative frequency plot used in the second accordion tab, which updates every day at 9 am CT.
- `plot_framework.rda`: An ggplot object for the frequency plot, minus the red line, used to generate the final image.
- `plover_audio.mp3`: The audio file used for the "Click to Listen" button, originally from [All About Birds](allaboutbirds.org)
- `pxArt.png`: The favicon photo, created by plugging a Creative Commons licensed photo into a pixel art generator.
