      <p>This story was created as a project for a data journalism class at Northwestern University, taught by Professor Matt Kiefer in Spring 2025.</p>
      <p>This site is powered by <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, and the code in the repository is open source. This includes the R and Python scripts used to analyze and scrape data, as well as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript used to format this site. All raw data is stored locally.</p>
      <p>The StoryMap was created using the <a href = "knightlab.northwestern.edu">Knight Lab's</a> interface. All of the images used in the slides are courtesy of the <a href = "https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/">Macaulay Library.</a></p>
      <p>The three primary visualizations — a column chart, scatter plot, and animated map — were created using <a href = "flourish.studio">Flourish</a>. The totals in the first two graphs are from my analysis of data from the <a href = "https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/download-ebird-data-products">eBird Basic Dataset</a>, and the map uses latitude and longitude data from those checklists. The images used in the pop-ups for the scatter plot are courtesy of <a href = "allaboutbirds.org">All About Birds</a>.</p>
      <p>For access to the code used for this project, click <a href = "https://github.com/aboyko22/piping-plovers">here</a>. For any questions about the story, analysis, or otherwise, feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:alexboyko2026@u.northwestern.edu">here</a>.</p>
